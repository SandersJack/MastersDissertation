In this paper, studies conducted at Queen’s University, focusing on the understanding, monitoring and improvement of the detector response will be presented. The detector consists of a 30 cm diameter sphere with a 2 mm anode at the center. With this set-up, we perform precision measurements with a UV laser and radioactive sources that encompass a wide range of fundamental characteristics of the detector.}

Neutrons can be measured successfully, with high sensitivity, using 3He gas in the detector. The proton and tritium energy deposition in the drift gaseous volume, from the reaction 3He(n,p)3H, can provide the neutron spectra from thermal neutrons up to several MeV. The α resolution of the detector has been measured using 222Rn gas, in order to have the response of the total active volume of the detector. The three α peaks from 222Rn decay and 222Rn daughters decay have been measured with FWHM less then 2%, with gas mixture Ar 98% and CH4 2% at a pressure of 200 mbar. The neutron sensitivity has been tested inserting in the sphere 100mgr of 3He. The 0.765 MeV peak of p and 3H is well separated form the cosmic ray background after irradiation with 252Cf neutron source. The ground level atmospheric thermal neutrons have been also measured after several hours of exposure. The very low noise, the limited wall effect, the high resolution and the high sensitivity are some of the advantages of the detector. },

A vibrating reed electrometer and current digitiser were used to measure the current produced by completely stopping the alpha particles in a large cylindrical ionisation chamber. A multichannel analyser, operating in a slow multiscalar mode, was used to store pulses from the current digitiser. The dwell time, of the order of 60 min per channel, was selected with an external timer gate. Current measurements were made at reduced pressures (200 Torr) to reduce ion recombination. The average current, over many repeated measurements, was compared to the current produced in nitrogen and its previously published W-value of 36.39+or-0.04 eV per ion pair.}

abstractNote = {This paper presents the NUBASE2016 evaluation that contains the recommended values for nuclear and decay properties of 3437 nuclides in their ground and excited isomeric (T1/2≥100 ns) states. All nuclides for which any experimental information is known were considered. NUBASE2016 covers all data published by October 2016 in primary (journal articles) and secondary (mainly laboratory reports and conference proceedings) references, together with the corresponding bibliographical information. During the development of NUBASE2016, the data available in the “Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File” (ENSDF) database were consulted and critically assessed for their validity and completeness. Furthermore, a large amount of new data and some older experimental results that were missing from ENSDF were compiled, evaluated and included in NUBASE2016. The atomic mass values were taken from the “Atomic Mass Evaluation” (AME2016, second and third parts of the present issue). In cases where no experimental data were available for a particular nuclide, trends in the behavior of specific properties in neighboring nuclides (TNN) were examined. This approach allowed to estimate values for a range of properties that are labeled in NUBASE2016 as “non-experimental” (flagged “#”). Evaluation procedures and policies used during the development of this database are presented, together with a detailed table of recommended values and their uncertainties.

 abstract = {The present state of knowledge about cosmic-ray neutrons is reviewed. The altitude dependence of the rate of production is investigated, employing neutron counters and the radio-balloon technique. A rate of increase with elevation is found which is equal to that of the soft component. Other experiments are described in which the coincidence between neutrons and showers is observed at two elevations, by observing the simultaneous discharge of neutron and shower counters. The calibrations and controls on the experiments are described. It is further shown that a cross section of less than 10-25 cm sq. will suffice to account for the observed number of neutrons if they are produced by photons. In summary, the altitude dependence, the observed coincidences and the cross section considerations all point to a production of the neutrons by the soft component presumably by a nuclear photodisintegration process.},

	abstract = {The safety assessment was carried out for ionization chamber smoke detectors (ICSDs) containing 241Am under normal use and accident scenarios. The internal and external doses were estimated using dose coefficients and associated calculations. In normal use of the ICSDs with the activity in a range of 0.002–1 MBq per ICSD, the external doses to an individual for installation, use and maintenance were found to lie in the range of (0.01-4.17)×10−3 (0.017 - 6.76)×10−1 and (0.006-2.5)×10−2 μSv/y respectively. The activity of 241Am for domestic smoke detectors contains approximately 40 kBq per ICSD. The corresponding committed effective doses to a fire fighter during a fire and for cleanup operation after a fire via inhalation were found to be 6.1×10−5 and 0.024 μSv/y respectively. The committed effective dose equivalent to an infant via ingestion would be 148 μSv/y. The doses arising from normal use and incidents of ICSDs are less than 10 μSv/y and 1 mSv/y respectively which do not exceed the dose criteria for exemption from regulatory control. It could be concluded that the resultant radiological risk are estimated to be very low and lower than 1 mSv which is the annual dose limit to a member of the public for the safe use.}

abstract = {A technique to measure low intensity fast neutron flux has been developed. The design, calibrations, procedure for data analysis and interpretation of the results are discussed in detail. The technique has been applied to measure the neutron background from rock at the Boulby Underground Laboratory, a site used for dark matter and other experiments, requiring shielding from cosmic ray muons. The experiment was performed using a liquid scintillation detector. A 6.1l volume stainless steel cell was filled with an in-house made liquid scintillator loaded with Gd to enhance neutron capture. A two-pulse signature (proton recoils followed by gammas from neutron capture) was used to identify the neutron events from much larger gamma background from PMTs. Suppression of gammas from the rock was achieved by surrounding the detector with high-purity lead and copper. Calibrations of the detector were performed with various gamma and neutron sources. Special care was taken to eliminate PMT afterpulses and correlated background events from the delayed coincidences of two pulses in the Bi-Po decay chain. A four month run revealed a neutron-induced event rate of 1.84±0.65(stat.) events/day. Monte Carlo simulations based on the GEANT4 toolkit were carried out to estimate the efficiency of the detector and the energy spectra of the expected proton recoils. From comparison of the measured rate with Monte Carlo simulations the flux of fast neutrons from rock was estimated as (1.72±0.61(stat.)±0.38(syst.))×10−6cm−2s−1 above 0.5MeV.}
